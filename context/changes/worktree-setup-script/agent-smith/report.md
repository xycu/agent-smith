# Run report: worktree-setup-script

Goal: Refactor duplicated run-isolation setup into a dependency-free prepare-run.mjs shared by both pipeline skills, preserving all existing isolation cases, safe resume behavior, subdirectory handling and file timestamps. Follow context/changes/worktree-setup-script/change.md and test every setup case through the real script. Own prepare-run.mjs and both skills Start step 3 in Wave 4. Respect the Wave 4 ownership table in context/changes/WAVES.md, resolve historical paths against current layout, leave WAVES.md to the post-wave maintenance change, and avoid changes owned by sibling runs. Shared documentation and skill-content tests may be updated only for this change's behavior.
Rigor: standard (goal hard)
Outcome: halt - Step 1 (score) hit its limit of 2 neutral reruns after orchestrator faults (limits.maxNeutralRetries). Needs a human. Fix the harness, then either write a result file with the real status (the router verifies the step by its files), or raise limits.maxNeutralRetries in context/foundation/agent-smith-policy.json and write the orchestrator-error result file again, then run next.

## Neutral reruns

Steps returned again unchanged (same prompt, model and effort) after the orchestrator declared a fault of its own; no failed attempt was counted. The notes are the orchestrator's.

- step 1 score: 2 reruns after an orchestrator fault
