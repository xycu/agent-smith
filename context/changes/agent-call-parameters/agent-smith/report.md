# Run report: agent-call-parameters

Goal: Make both pipeline skills describe valid Agent calls with and without run_in_background, give each step and archive agent a deterministic description, and use that identity for completion and late usage correlation. Follow context/changes/agent-call-parameters/change.md. Preserve OpenAI runner dispatch. Own Loop step 2, anti-stall rules 1 and 6, and late-usage prose in Wave 4. Record unavailable live Claude acceptance honestly. Respect the Wave 4 ownership table in context/changes/WAVES.md, resolve historical paths against current layout, leave WAVES.md to the post-wave maintenance change, and avoid changes owned by sibling runs. Shared documentation and skill-content tests may be updated only for this change's behavior.
Rigor: standard (goal plain)
Outcome: halt - Step 1 (score) hit its limit of 2 neutral reruns after orchestrator faults (limits.maxNeutralRetries). Needs a human. Fix the harness, then either write a result file with the real status (the router verifies the step by its files), or raise limits.maxNeutralRetries in context/foundation/agent-smith-policy.json and write the orchestrator-error result file again, then run next.

## Neutral reruns

Steps returned again unchanged (same prompt, model and effort) after the orchestrator declared a fault of its own; no failed attempt was counted. The notes are the orchestrator's.

- step 1 score: 2 reruns after an orchestrator fault
